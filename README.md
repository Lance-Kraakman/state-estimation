# state-estimation

### This project is test scripts for the design of a kalman filter for a position estimation system. 
- The Prediction uses the dead reckoning system to estimate the next Position.
- Then measurements are also obtained.
- The system dynamics (Accelleration, Velocity etc) are then estimated using this data. (And some probability)
